/*
 * Write a program to calculate the Quadratic formula. Let the user input a, b, and c. 
 * You need an if-statement to check if the number under the radical is negative or not. 
 * If not, just print out that you cannot perform the calculation. 
 * If the number under the radical is 0, only print out 1 answer. If it is positive, print out both answers.
