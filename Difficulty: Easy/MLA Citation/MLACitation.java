 * When you distribute information you found from another source, you must always cite your source.
 * The MLA format for a formal citation for a book is as follows:
 * 
 * Last name, First name of author. Title of the Book. Publisher, Year of publication.
 * 
 * Write a citation generator. Your program should ask for:

    The author’s name in the form “Last Name, First Name”
    The date the book was published
    The title of the book
    The publisher

 * Then print out the information in the format shown above. Pay attention to the periods and commas!
